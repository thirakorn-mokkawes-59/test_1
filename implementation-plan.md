# Implementation Plan – Web-Based P&ID Editor with DEXPI XML + SVG Export

This plan breaks the project into **5 development phases** with concrete features, milestones, and success criteria. Adjust timelines to your team’s velocity (typical durations are suggested for a 2-4 person team).

---

## Phase 0 – Preparation & Foundations (≈1 week)

| Task | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| 1. Confirm Requirements | Final scope, supported browsers, performance targets |
| 2. Set Up Monorepo | `pnpm init`, workspaces for `client/` & `server/` |
| 3. DevOps Baseline | Git, ESLint + Prettier, Husky pre-commit, CI pipeline |
| 4. Choose Libraries | Finalise React + Vite, SVG.js/draw2d.js, Tailwind, Express |
| 5. Bootstrap Skeleton | “Hello World” app served from Node; hot-reload working |

**Milestone 0:** Clean repository, CI passes, empty app runs locally and on staging URL.

## Phase 1 – Canvas MVP (≈3 weeks)

Feature goals  
1. Interactive SVG canvas (pan, zoom, grid, snap)  
2. Basic symbol palette (pump, valve, instrument, pipe line)  
3. Select / move / delete elements  
4. In-memory JSON diagram model

Key Steps  
- Integrate SVG.js wrapper inside `Canvas.tsx`.  
- Implement `useCanvas()` hook for viewport state.  
- Build resizable/rotatable symbol React components.  
- Store diagram graph in React context (no persistence yet).  

**Milestone 1:** Users draw a simple pump-valve-pipe loop and reposition items fluidly.

---

## Phase 2 – DEXPI Data Model & Export (≈4 weeks)

Feature goals  
1. Full TypeScript interfaces mirroring DEXPI schema  
2. Property editor side-panel (tag, service, design data)  
3. JSON ⇄ DEXPI XML serializer (`xmlSerializer.ts`)  
4. “Export as SVG” (client-side)  
5. “Export as DEXPI XML” with schema validation (server endpoint)

Key Steps  
- Generate types via `xsd2ts` or hand-craft essential subset.  
- Map canvas entities to DEXPI classes (Equipment, Port, Stream).  
- Bundle official XSD in server `/dexpi/schema/`; validate via `libxmljs`.  
- Implement file-download utility (`FileSaver.js`).  

**Milestone 2:** Round-trip: draw → export XML → re-import → identical diagram.

---

## Phase 3 – Diagram Integrity & Advanced UX (≈3 weeks)

Feature goals  
1. Connection rules (e.g., line can only attach to ports)  
2. Live validation hints (red highlights, message tray)  
3. Undo/redo history (immer or `use-undo` hook)  
4. Search & filter (by tag/service)  
5. Template diagrams & symbol categories

Key Steps  
- Add topology checker in `validators.ts`.  
- Introduce global `commandStack` for undo/redo.  
- Create quick-add dialogs & keyboard shortcuts.  

**Milestone 3:** Editor prevents illegal connections; users can confidently create production-quality P&IDs.

---

## Phase 4 – Collaboration & Deployment (≈4 weeks)

Feature goals  
1. Server-side projects & auth (JWT, PostgreSQL)  
2. Multi-user locking or CRDT real-time editing (optional)  
3. Cloud deployment (Docker, Fly.io/AWS ECS)  
4. Public demo with sample diagrams

Key Steps  
- Extend server to store diagrams (DEXPI XML blobs).  
- Add login/register UI.  
- Configure CI → CD pipeline.  

**Milestone 4:** Deployed SaaS where users sign in, edit diagrams, and download DEXPI/SVG.

---

## Phase 5 – Hardening & Maintenance (ongoing)

- Performance profiling (large P&IDs ≥5 k elements)  
- Accessibility (WCAG 2.1) & i18n  
- Automated E2E tests (Playwright)  
- Versioned API & migration scripts  
- Community feedback loop / roadmap grooming

## High-Level Timeline (illustrative)

| Month | Phase | Major Deliverable |
|-------|-------|-------------------|
| 1 | 0 → 1 | Canvas MVP |
| 2 | 2 | DEXPI-compliant export |
| 3 | 3 | Validated editing experience |
| 4 | 4 | Public beta deployment |
| 5+ | 5 | Scaling & feature refinement |

---

## Roles & Responsibilities

| Role | Key Focus |
|------|-----------|
| Front-End Dev | Canvas, UI/UX, React state |
| Back-End Dev | XML validation, storage, auth |
| Domain Expert | DEXPI compliance, P&ID semantics |
| QA | Test plans, schema conformance |

---

## Success Criteria

1. 100 % XSD-valid DEXPI export for reference diagrams.  
2. Sub-1 s canvas interaction latency with 2 k+ elements.  
3. Zero schema violations after import–export round-trip tests.  
4. Positive feedback from pilot process engineers.

**Next Action:** ✳ Start Phase 0 – clone repo, configure workspace, and schedule kick-off meeting.
